# Project Introduction

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, my goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

### The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise.

1. The "classe" variable in the training set is the outcome variable.  
2. We can use any of the other variables to predict with.
3. I will create a report describing how I built my model, how I used cross validation, what I think the expected out of sample error is, and why I made the choices I did.
